  <h1>Permission denied for reentry of Vardas orbiting experiment capsule</h1>
  <h3>The FAA says Varda launched its vehicle into space without a reentry license.</h3>

  <h4>Some facts aboout the Varda that was launched:</h4>
  <div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item"><p>Enlarge / Varda's reentry capsule measures nearly 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter and will jettison from its Rocket Lab-built carrier spacecraft when the mission is ready to return to Earth.</p></div>
    <div class="grid-item"><p>A first-of-its-kind commercial spacecraft owned by an in-space manufacturing startup called Varda Space Industries has been in orbit two months longer than originally planned, waiting for government approval to return to Earth with a cache of pharmaceutical specimens.</p></div>
    <div class="grid-item"><p>Varda's satellite launched on June 12 for what was originally supposed to be a monthlong mission to demonstrate the company's technology for producing commercial materials, mainly pharmaceuticals, inside a recoverable capsule designed to return the products to Earth for laboratory analysis and eventual commercial exploitation.</p></div>

    <p>However, the recovery of Varda's capsule is on hold after the Federal Aviation Administration and the US Air Force recently declined to give Varda approval to land its spacecraft in a remote part of Utah. TechCrunch first reported the FAA turned down Varda's application for a commercial reentry license. "Varda Space Industries launched its vehicle into space without a reentry license," an FAA spokesperson told Ars on Wednesday. "The FAA denied the Varda reentry license application on September 6 because the company did not demonstrate compliance with the regulatory requirements. "The FAA spokesperson said Varda formally requested that the regulatory agency reconsider its decision two days later. "The request for reconsideration is pending," the FAA said.</p>
    <h2>Untested waters</h2>
        <p>The FAA's Office of Space Operations is responsible for licensing commercial launch and reentry operations, but the lion's share of its work has been reviewing applications for launch licenses. The FAA has licensed 82 commercial launches so far this year, already more than it licensed in all of 2022. Ten years ago, the FAA licensed eight commercial launches. The tenfold increase in US commercial launch activity over the last decade has been almost entirely driven by SpaceX's rising launch cadence. The FAA has requested more funding to hire personnel and keep up with the fast-growing commercial space industry.</p>
